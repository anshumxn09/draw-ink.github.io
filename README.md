# draw-ink.github.io
when covid was there we used to attend lectures online and teacher were used to teach us on whiteboard/pentab, DRAW-INK is also kind of similar to it , CANVAS plays an important role while implementing the project in HTML. Styling - CSS, LOGIC - Javascript , learned alot while working on this and understand how the pentab works!
